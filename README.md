## note

Be careful, this script is not going to make you immortal
**It just helps that a higher percentage of your shots land near the right spot (the head)**.

**Tried not to be identified by players**
And as far as it has been tested online, it is not recognized

It works unless you hold the **'alt'** button and shoot so it doesn't work!

## install requirement

```commandline

pip install pymem
pip install keyboard
pip install mouse
pip install pyautogui
pip install math

```

**Warning:** the csgo.py file may be invalidated in the updates. From the dumper folder, run the dumper.exe file (while running the game) to give you a new file and select it.


## run

```commandline

python glow.py

```
